I started learning C and this is one exercise I did. Feel free to suggest me anything if you end up in here.
I passed it to a friend on Windows and his computer gives different results if compiled on my machine (arch linux), and if using wine i trigger line 34, the area results in 0 for some reason. 
If anyone knows why let me know.
